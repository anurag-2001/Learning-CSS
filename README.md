# Learning-CSS
 Using comments we highlighted the work flow of CSS
 As I have tried to learn CSS from basics so I noted down all the commands that were more usefull for me.

CSS:Cascading Style Sheets converts an off loading HTML page into a beautiful & responsive website.
CSS is very demanded skill in world of web development.If we are successfully  able to master CSS,we can customize our own websites as per our choice.

Create a .css file inside our directory and add it to your HTML.
Actually there are three ways to add CSS to HTML
1) <style> tag (adding style tag in head seaction of HTML)
2) Inline CSS  (adding CSS style attributes in HTML line)  
3) External CSS (.css file and then link in to HTML by LINK command)

Creating a page layout:When we used the right tag in right place,it results in a better page layout,better
indexing by search engines and better user experience.We use the following tag to get the job done...
    i) <header>
    ii) <main>    
    iii) <footer>
